title: New OpenCV 4.0 Beta & OpenVINO™ toolkit
---

<p>Dear OpenCV Community,</p>

<p>We are glad to announce that OpenCV 4.0 Beta is now available, which includes many new features and enhancements. Along with this new library, are new open source tools to help fast-track high performance computer vision development and deep learning inference in OpenVINO™ toolkit (Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization). More details about these releases and where to download follow.</p>

<h3>OpenCV 4.0 Beta—What’s New</h3>

<p>OpenCV 4.0 Beta includes 29 new patches, including massive merges from 3.4 branch, since OpenCV 4.0 alpha (<a href="https://opencv.org/opencv-4-0-0-alpha.html">https://opencv.org/opencv-4-0-0-alpha.html</a>):
<ul>
<li>ONNX* (Open Neural Network Exchange) importer has been further improved to support more topologies.</li>
<li>OpenCV DNN sample object_detection.py has been improved to fill in the right model parameters, so it’s much easier to use now.</li>
<li>G-API (Graph API) - super-efficient image processing pipeline engine has been integrated as <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/gapi">opencv_gapi module</a></li>
<li>Fast QR code decoder, based on free QUirc (<a href="https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc">https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc</a>) library has been integrated, so now we have a complete QR-code detection and decoding pipeline (that runs ~20-80FPS @ 640x480 resolution).</li>
<li>18 functions, over 60 kernels have been accelerated for AVX2 using “wide universal intrinsics.”</li>
<li>Kinect Fusion algorithm has been accelerated for iGPU, which resulted in ~3x speedup over parallel CPU version on high-resolution volume (512x512x512).</li>
</ul>
The release should be quite stable, but more changes are expected by OpenCV 4.0 gold.</p>
